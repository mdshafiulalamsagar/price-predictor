    This app predicts house prices in Bengaluru using machine learning. 
    The model was trained on real estate data from Bengaluru and uses 
    features like location, square footage, number of bathrooms, and BHK configuration.
    
    **Note:** To fix the feature mismatch error, ensure that:
    1. Your training and prediction data have exactly the same features
    2. You use the same preprocessing pipeline for both training and prediction
    3. You handle categorical variables (like location) consistently
